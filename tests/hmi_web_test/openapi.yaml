Expressions are abstractly represented as a collection of identifiers, select statements, function calls, literals, and comprehensions. All operators with the exception of the '.' operator are modelled as function calls. This makes it easy to represent new operators into the existing AST. All references within expressions must resolve to a [Decl][cel.expr.Decl] provided at type-check for an expression to be valid. A reference may either be a bare identifier `name` or a qualified identifier `google.api.name`. References may either refer to a value or a function declaration. For example, the expression `google.api.name.startsWith('expr')` references the declaration `google.api.name` within a [Expr.Select][cel.expr.Expr.Select] expression, and the function declaration `startsWith`.

      description: "A comprehension expression applied to a list or map. Comprehensions are not part of the core syntax, but enabled with macros. A macro matches a specific call signature within a parsed AST and replaces the call with an alternate AST block. Macro expansion happens at parse time. The following macros are supported within CEL: Aggregate type macros may be applied to all elements in a list or all keys in a map: *  `all`, `exists`, `exists_one` -  test a predicate expression against    the inputs and return `true` if the predicate is satisfied for all,    any, or only one value `list.all(x, x < 10)`. *  `filter` - test a predicate expression against the inputs and return    the subset of elements which satisfy the predicate:    `payments.filter(p, p > 1000)`. *  `map` - apply an expression to all elements in the input and return the    output aggregate type: `[1, 2, 3].map(i, i * i)`. The `has(m.x)` macro tests whether the property `x` is present in struct `m`. The semantics of this macro depend on the type of `m`. For proto2 messages `has(m.x)` is defined as 'defined, but not set`. For proto3, the macro tests whether the property is set to its default. For map and struct types, the macro tests whether the property `x` is defined on `m`. Comprehensions for the standard environment macros evaluation can be best visualized as the following pseudocode: ``` let `accu_var` = `accu_init` for (let `iter_var` in `iter_range`) {   if (!`loop_condition`) {     break   }   `accu_var` = `loop_step` } return `result` ``` Comprehensions for the optional V2 macros which support map-to-map translation differ slightly from the standard environment macros in that they expose both the key or index in addition to the value for each list or map entry: ``` let `accu_var` = `accu_init` for (let `iter_var`, `iter_var2` in `iter_range`) {   if (!`loop_condition`) {     break   }   `accu_var` = `loop_step` } return `result` ```"

Range is approximately +-10,000 years. # Examples Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.     Timestamp start = ...;     Timestamp end = ...;     Duration duration = ...;     duration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds;     duration.nanos = end.nanos - start.nanos;     if (duration.seconds < 0 && duration.nanos > 0) {       duration.seconds += 1;       duration.nanos -= 1000000000;     } else if (duration.seconds > 0 && duration.nanos < 0) {       duration.seconds -= 1;       duration.nanos += 1000000000;     } Example 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.

          description: For message and enum types, this is the name of the type.  If the name starts with a '.', it is fully-qualified.  Otherwise, C++-like scoping rules are used to find the type (i.e. first the nested types within this message are searched, then within the parent, on up to the root namespace).

        proto3Optional:
          type: boolean
          description: If true, this is a proto3 "optional". When a proto3 field is optional, it tracks presence regardless of field type. When proto3_optional is true, this field must belong to a oneof to signal to old proto3 clients that presence is tracked for this field. This oneof is known as a "synthetic" oneof, and this field must be its sole member (each proto3 optional field gets its own synthetic oneof). Synthetic oneofs exist in the descriptor only, and do not generate any API. Synthetic oneofs must be ordered after all "real" oneofs. For message fields, proto3_optional doesn't create any semantic change, since non-repeated message fields always track presence. However it still indicates the semantic detail of whether the user wrote "optional" or not. This can be useful for round-tripping the .proto file. For consistency we give message fields a synthetic oneof also, even though it is not required to track presence. This is especially important because the parser can't tell if a field is a message or an enum, so it must always create a synthetic oneof. Proto2 optional fields do not set this flag, because they already indicate optional with `LABEL_OPTIONAL`.

    google.protobuf.FieldOptions:
      type: object
      properties:
        ctype:
          enum:
            - STRING
            - CORD
            - STRING_PIECE
          type: string
          description: 'NOTE: ctype is deprecated. Use `features.(pb.cpp).string_type` instead. The ctype option instructs the C++ code generator to use a different representation of the field than it normally would.  See the specific options below.  This option is only implemented to support use of [ctype=CORD] and [ctype=STRING] (the default) on non-repeated fields of type "bytes" in the open source release. TODO: make ctype actually deprecated.'
          format: enum
        packed:
          type: boolean
          description: The packed option can be enabled for repeated primitive fields to enable a more efficient representation on the wire. Rather than repeatedly writing the tag and type for each element, the entire array is encoded as a single length-delimited blob. In proto3, only explicit setting it to false will avoid using packed encoding.  This option is prohibited in Editions, but the `repeated_field_encoding` feature can be used to control the behavior.
        jstype:
          enum:
            - JS_NORMAL
            - JS_STRING
            - JS_NUMBER
          type: string
          description: The jstype option determines the JavaScript type used for values of the field.  The option is permitted only for 64 bit integral and fixed types (int64, uint64, sint64, fixed64, sfixed64).  A field with jstype JS_STRING is represented as JavaScript string, which avoids loss of precision that can happen when a large value is converted to a floating point JavaScript. Specifying JS_NUMBER for the jstype causes the generated JavaScript code to use the JavaScript "number" type.  The behavior of the default option JS_NORMAL is implementation dependent. This option is an enum to permit additional types to be added, e.g. goog.math.Integer.
          format: enum
        lazy:
          type: boolean
          description: Should this field be parsed lazily?  Lazy applies only to message-type fields.  It means that when the outer message is initially parsed, the inner message's contents will not be parsed but instead stored in encoded form.  The inner message will actually be parsed when it is first accessed. This is only a hint.  Implementations are free to choose whether to use eager or lazy parsing regardless of the value of this option.  However, setting this option true suggests that the protocol author believes that using lazy parsing on this field is worth the additional bookkeeping overhead typically needed to implement it. This option does not affect the public interface of any generated code; all method signatures remain the same.  Furthermore, thread-safety of the interface is not affected by this option; const methods remain safe to call from multiple threads concurrently, while non-const methods continue to require exclusive access. Note that lazy message fields are still eagerly verified to check ill-formed wireformat or missing required fields. Calling IsInitialized() on the outer message would fail if the inner message has missing required fields. Failed verification would result in parsing failure (except when uninitialized messages are acceptable).
        unverifiedLazy:
          type: boolean
          description: unverified_lazy does no correctness checks on the byte stream. This should only be used where lazy with verification is prohibitive for performance reasons.
        deprecated:
          type: boolean
          description: Is this field deprecated? Depending on the target platform, this can emit Deprecated annotations for accessors, or it will be completely ignored; in the very least, this is a formalization for deprecating fields.
        weak:
          type: boolean

          description: 'A Location identifies a piece of source code in a .proto file which corresponds to a particular definition.  This information is intended to be useful to IDEs, code indexers, documentation generators, and similar tools. For example, say we have a file like:   message Foo {     optional string foo = 1;   } Let''s look at just the field definition:   optional string foo = 1;   ^       ^^     ^^  ^  ^^^   a       bc     de  f  ghi We have the following locations:   span   path               represents   [a,i)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0 ]     The whole field definition.   [a,b)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 4 ]  The label (optional).   [c,d)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 5 ]  The type (string).   [e,f)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 1 ]  The name (foo).   [g,h)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 3 ]  The number (1). Notes: - A location may refer to a repeated field itself (i.e. not to any   particular index within it).  This is used whenever a set of elements are   logically enclosed in a single code segment.  For example, an entire   extend block (possibly containing multiple extension definitions) will   have an outer location whose path refers to the "extensions" repeated   field without an index. - Multiple locations may have the same path.  This happens when a single   logical declaration is spread out across multiple places.  The most   obvious example is the "extend" block again -- there may be multiple   extend blocks in the same scope, each of which will have the same path. - A location''s span is not always a subset of its parent''s span.  For   example, the "extendee" of an extension declaration appears at the   beginning of the "extend" block and is shared by all extensions within   the block. - Just because a location''s span is a subset of some other location''s span   does not mean that it is a descendant.  For example, a "group" defines   both a type and a field in a single declaration.  Thus, the locations   corresponding to the type and field and their components will overlap. - Code which tries to interpret locations should probably be designed to   ignore those that it doesn''t understand, as more types of locations could   be recorded in the future.'

This reference page doesn't carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.).

Note that volume reservations can also generate conflicts with the geometrical state of the world. E.g., a volume reservation that intersects static geometry would not be schedulable even when the skill is executing by itself.

      description: "Component indicating the owner is a collections Entity, which aggregates typed collections (e.g. LINKS, JOINTS, etc.) of other Entities. Some key properties: * Basics   - Collections are ordered sets, meaning each member appears exactly once.   - Some types of collections have additional invariants, documented below.   - Otherwise, no other guarantees (e.g. ordering, continguousness) are made     about a collection's members. * Entities   - The collections Entity (a.k.a. collection parent) is not part of the     attachment graph.   - The referenced Entities, called members, are in the attachment graph.   - Member Entities have CollectionsMemberComponents with backreferences to     the collections Entity.   - An Entity can be a member of any number of collections, spread across the     same or different collections Entities. Some examples: * A robot (specifically what was previously represented through   RobotComponent) will have LINKS and JOINTS collections and optionally   a COORDINATE_FRAME collection. Additionally, the JOINTS collection will   have at least 1 degree of freedom (i.e. joint of non-fixed motion type). * An SDF <model> containing only static geometry is translated into a   collections Entity with only a LINKS collection.

    description: |-
      The Executive is responsible for executing and monitoring Behavior Trees.

       Given the declarative description in the form of a behavior tree, the
       Executive executes the tree according to the defined semantics, for example,
       by executing one child after the other for a sequence node. As part of the
       execution it invokes skills according to the skill API contract.

       Key concepts of the executive:
       - Behavior Tree: declarative behavior specification to define a process.
       - Blackboard: an internal key-value store for data flow.
       - Operation: the operational envelope for one Behavior Tree.

       The concept of an operation is central to the Executive Service API: by
       creating an operation a behavior tree is loaded. Then the operation
       is the reference item to start, suspend, resume. The operation and in
       turn the Behavior Tree it encloses.
       Note: at this point in time there can be at most one operation. Creating a
       second operation fails, even if the previous operation was completed. It
       must be deleted (and possibly stopped if still active) before creating
       another one.
