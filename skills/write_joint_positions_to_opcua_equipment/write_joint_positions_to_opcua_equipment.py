"""Contains the skill write_joint_positions_to_opcua_equipment.

This skill connects to an opcua_equipment which has been configured with
variables that represent the joint positions of a 6-axis robot arm, where
joints 1-6 are matched to signal names lrAxis1 - lrAxis6.

It is also assumed that the opcua_equipment has been configured with a "Write"
command that writes the an array of double values to the variables on the opcua_equipment.

The skill reads the current sensed joint positions of the robot arm, and writes them to the
opcua_equipment.

The signal names of these variables, as well as the rest of the configuration
of the opcua_equipment can be found in the accompanying `example_opcua_equipment_config.pbtxt`
file. This configuration must be uploaded to the equipment via Flowstate
before the skill can communicate with the equipment properly.

For more information about configuring OPCUA equipment, refer to
https://developers.intrinsic.ai/guides/workcell_design/adding_new_hardware?hl=en#opcua-equipment.
